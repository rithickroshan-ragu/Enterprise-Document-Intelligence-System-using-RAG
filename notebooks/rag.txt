Introduction:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances language model generation by incorporating external knowledge.
This is typically done by retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of documents and using that information to inform the generation process.
Challenge:
Clients often have vast proprietary documents.
Extracting specific information is like finding a needle in a haystack.
2. GPT4-Turbo Introduction:
OpenAI’s GPT4-Turbo can process large documents.
3. Efficiency Issue:
“Lost In The Middle” phenomenon hampers efficiency.
Model forgets content in the middle of its contextual window.
4. Alternative Approach — Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG):
Create an index for each document paragraph.
Swiftly identify pertinent paragraphs.
Feed selected paragraphs into a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT4.
5. Advantages:
Prevents information overload.
Enhances result quality by providing only relevant paragraphs.
The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
With RAG, the LLM is able to leverage knowledge and information that is not necessarily in its weights by providing it access to external knowledge sources such as databases.
It leverages a retriever to find relevant contexts to condition the LLM, in this way, RAG is able to augment the knowledge-base of an LLM with relevant documents.
The retriever here could be any of the following depending on the need for semantic retrieval or not:
Vector database: Typically, queries are embedded using models like BERT for generating dense vector embeddings. Alternatively, traditional methods like TF-IDF can be used for sparse embeddings. The search is then conducted based on term frequency or semantic similarity.
Graph database: Constructs a knowledge base from extracted entity relationships within the text. This approach is precise but may require exact query matching, which could be restrictive in some applications.
Regular SQL database: Offers structured data storage and retrieval but might lack the semantic flexibility of vector databases.
